# Reel Browser

## Approach

My approach with this app feature was focused on 3 key points.

1. To make an incredibly simple and clean UI that is intuitive on any device.
2. Focus on the reel items and to let them drive the design of the feature creatively.
3. Get away from just a plain progress "bar" and to build the whole reel component around it.

## Tools

I made use of a node package that I sent the product image to and received back data of the image's color pallete. Then I built out the design of the app in adobe XD with focus on making a modern clean ui that relies on those colors to catch the eye of users.
